Counting
These days kids are introduced to computers at a very early age. The kids are taught about alphabets, digits and blank spaces. 
The teacher asked the students to count the vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces in a string. The teacher found it a bit difficult to evaluate these tests and she knew that the 12th class students are learning C programming. So she assigned this task to them to count the vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces in a string. Can you please help them out? Write a program to count the vowels, consonants, digits, white spaces, and symbols in a string.

Input &output Format:
Input consists of a string. Assume the maximum length of the string is 200. The characters in the string can contain both uppercase and lowercase. Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input:
This program is very easy 2 complete

Sample Output:
Vowels : 10
Consonants : 19
White spaces : 6
Digits : 1
Symbols : 0


Input (stdin)
At 16 years of age, Sachin was supposed to face the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.

Output (stdout)
Vowels:29
Consonants:40
White Spaces:17
Digits:2
Symbols:2

Input (stdin)
The main contribution by Sachin was the way he changed the opening in ODI cricket.

Output (stdout)
Vowels:25
Consonants:42
White Spaces:14
Digits:0
Symbols:1

Input (stdin)
Australia in those days was termed as the invincibles. Playing against Australia was always the toughest challenge that a batsman can face in those days.

Output (stdout)
Vowels:49
Consonants:78
White Spaces:24
Digits:0
Symbols:2

PROGRAM IN CPP

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    char str[200];
  cin.getline(str,200);
  int vowel=0, consonant=0, digit=0, space=0, symbol=0;
  for(int i=0 ; str[i]!='\0'; i++)
  {
    if(str[i]=='a' || str[i]=='e' || str[i]=='i' || str[i]=='o' || str[i]=='u' || str[i]=='A' || str[i]=='E' || str[i]=='I' || str[i]=='O' || str[i]=='U')
      vowel++;
    else if((str[i]>='a' && str[i]<='z') || (str[i]>='A' && str[i]<='Z'))
      consonant++;
    else if(str[i]>='0' && str[i]<='9')
      digit++;
    else if(str[i]==' ')
      space++;
    else
      symbol++;
  }
  cout<<"Vowels:"<<vowel<<endl;
  cout<<"Consonants:"<<consonant<<endl;
  cout<<"White Spaces:"<<space<<endl;

  cout<<"Symbols:"<<symbol<<endl;
