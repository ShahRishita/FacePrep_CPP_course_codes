Catchy caption
Company Tesla has kept a contest for catchy caption for the image. They have a rule that the caption should not be more than 10 words. If the caption of a candidate is more than 10 words, then the candidature stands to be disqualified. Can you write a program to check whether a caption is eligible for the contest or not.
The maximum sizeof the caption is of 100 bytes.



[Hint:Use functions defined in cstring]

  {
    if(str[i]==' ')
