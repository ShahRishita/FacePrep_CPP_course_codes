Microwave oven
A microwave oven manufacturer recommends to increase the heating time by 50% when two items are heated and to double the heating time when three items are heated. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Now, write a program to find out the recommended heating time.
INPUT FORMAT:

The first input is an integer which denotes the number of items

The second input is a floating point number which denotes the single item heating time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the recommended heating time in floating point with 2 decimal places.

If the number of items is more than three, print "Number of items is more".

Refer the sample output for formatting.

      total_time = heat_time + heat_time*(50/100.0) ;
      cout<<total_time;
    }
    else if(item == 3)
    {
      total_time = 2*heat_time;
      cout<<total_time;
    }
    else
      cout<<"Number of items is more";
    return 0;
