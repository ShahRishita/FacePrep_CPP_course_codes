He needs to create particular amount of bacteria. The bacteria multiplies exponentially. If he lets m bacteria to multiply n exponential times, he should check whether he will get the required amount of bacteria.
Input consists of three inputs. The no. of bacteria, m. The number in which it gets multiplied, n. The required number, req .

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
  int m, n, req;
  cin>>m>>n>>req;
  int result = Experiment(m,n);
  if(result>=req)
    cout<<"Doctor, you can proceed with your experiment.";
  else
    cout<<"Sorry Doctor! You need more bacteria.";
  return 0;
}

int Experiment(int m, int n)
{
  return pow(m,n);
}
