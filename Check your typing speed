Check you typing speed!
Cicily is organizing a typing competition. Each participant who clears the competition receives a certificate and a cash prize. The initial mark is ten. For each mistake made, one mark is reduced. If the participant's score is an absolute value, he/she will be rewarded. Can you help Cicily to write a program where she enters the id of a participant and the score obtained, and the program should print the result for that candidate.
