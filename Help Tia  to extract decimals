Help Tia to extract decimals
Tia is new to programming.
She needs to write a program which will receive the input as a floating point number.
She needs to print the decimal part of the floating point of the number. 
She has written a few lines of code. Can you fill up the rest.
Read the input as string. Use string operations on the input to derive the answer easily.

Input (stdin)
-955.444

Output (stdout)
Floating part is : 444

Input (stdin)
5210.0

Output (stdout)
Floating part is : 0

PROGRAM IN CPP

#include <iostream>
#include<string.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{ int pos;
  string num,result;
  cin>>num;
  pos = num.find(".");
  if(pos>0)
    result.assign(num,pos+1);
  cout<<"Floating part is : "<<result;
  return 0;
 
 /*
  for(int i=0;i<num.length();i++)
  {
    if(num[i]=='.')
    {
      result.assign(num,i+1);
      break;
    }
  }
  cout<<"Floating part is : "<<result;
 */
}
