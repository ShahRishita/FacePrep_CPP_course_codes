PROGRAM IN CPP

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fibonacci(int n)
{
  if(n==0)
    return 0;
  else if(n==1)
    return 1;
  else 
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

int main() 
{
    int n;
  cin>>n;
  cout<<"The term "<<n<<" in the fibonacci series is "<<fibonacci(n-1);
    return 0;
}
